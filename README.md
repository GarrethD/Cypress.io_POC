# Cypress.io_POC
Cypress is a node based javascript/React testing framework capabile of easy e2e testing.

# Setup:
1.Install NodeJs

2.Follow the basic setup guid at https://www.cypress.io/ based on your OS.

3.Insatall VSCode. (Although not needed for running tests, I found that it was very lightweight and easy to hook up to cypress.)


# Run tests:
There are 2 ways of running tests:

1. Open cypress with command you have set up. If you need assistance follow the cypress.io doc on getting started.
  *once cypress is open you can simply click on the spec file you would like to run.
  
2. In command line/Terminal we can run the scripts we set up. In this Cypress Example we can use the command *"npm run scripts || npm run posttest"*
   We run "npm run scripts" to run all our spec files. Once that is done, we run "npm run posttest" to combine all reports into a single HTML file for easy viewing.

# Github CI pipeline
Currently no CI implementation or configuration files.


# Enhancements
There are a few things I would like to improve on. For starters I would like to remove all hardcoded Variables and add them to structured JSON files for easy iteration and implementation. This will help for scalability and reusability. For the uscase the framework was used, this was not necessary. 


# Thank You
Thank you for Reading this long Readme. I hope it was informative and gave a lot of info based on the apprach I took on writing RestAssure tests.
